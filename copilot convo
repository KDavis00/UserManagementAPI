ðŸŽ‰ Boom! That `201 Created` response means your **POST request worked perfectly**â€”you just added a new user to your API. Here's what happened:

---

## âœ… What You Just Did

- Sent a valid JSON body with user details
- Included the correct `Authorization` header
- Received a `201 Created` response with the new user object:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Alice",
    "lastName": "Johnson",
    "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
    "department": "Engineering"
  }
  ```

- The response also included a `Location` header:
  ```
  http://localhost:5080/api/User/1
  ```
  Thatâ€™s the URL to retrieve this user.

## ðŸ§ª Want to Confirm the User Was Added?

Run this GET request:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5080/api/user/1" -Method GET -Headers $headers
```

Or get all users:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:5080/api/user" -Method GET -Headers $headers
```

---

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?

You can now:
- âœ… Update the user with a PUT request
- âœ… Delete the user with a DELETE request
- âœ… Add more users and test filtering or searching
